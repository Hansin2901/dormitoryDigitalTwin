# Executor Agent - DEPRECATED
#
# The executor functionality has been folded into the PlannerAgent.
# The planner now calls tools directly using Gemini's function calling.
#
# This file is kept for potential future use if we want to separate
# query generation from execution, but for v1 the planner handles both.

# If needed in future, this could become a "QueryGenerator" that the
# planner calls to generate queries from natural language plans.
